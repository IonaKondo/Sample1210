SampleProgram2_20201209.cpp: version2 20201209  >> output2.txt
  #I have some modifications.
  #1. (line 29) change LOOP defenition because the adress '*ds++' become null in LOOP2. I do not the reason...
  #2. (line 76,77) modify how to define the parameters '*D' and '**ds' (line)  However I am not sure if the defenition 'ds=&D'

comments:
  # **ds (pointer to a pointer) which can be thought of as a 2D array
  #   ds should have a size of npixels x nframes. So, if you want to fit up the ramp using 3 frames of 5x5 pixel size
  #  *ds should point to the first row (that is the first frame) of an array of size 25 x 3
  

SampleProgram3_20201210.cpp: version3 20201210  >> output3.txt
  #I have some modifications from version2.
  #1. (line 32) undo the change of the defenition of 'LOOP'
  #2. (line 55-58,) define the 2D array for '**ds' 
  #(line 63 & 66-70 )I do not know how to initialize the adress position '*ds' increased by the LOOP in the Integral function.

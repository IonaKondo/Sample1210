  #I have some modifications.
  #1. (line 29) change LOOP defenition because the adress '*ds++' become null in LOOP2. I do not the reason...
  #2. (line 76,77) modify how to define the parameters '*D' and '**ds' (line)  However I am not sure if the defenition 'ds=&D'

comments:
  # **ds (pointer to a pointer) which can be thought of as a 2D array
  #   ds should have a size of npixels x nframes. So, if you want to fit up the ramp using 3 frames of 5x5 pixel size
  #  *ds should point to the first row (that is the first frame) of an array of size 25 x 3
